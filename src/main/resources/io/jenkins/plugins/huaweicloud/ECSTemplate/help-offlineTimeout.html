    When the offline time of an offline node exceeds the set value, the node and its corresponding machine will be deleted to reduce unnecessary costs.<br>
    This is especially useful when selecting "Idle Timeout Disconnect", because the machine that is shut down will be deleted after the specified time period expires.<br>
    The default value is 12 hours, unit: minutes.
